## **Description**

This repository represents my solution to tasks given at Central University as task for STEM. Also, you can find here a
baseline for a [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cu-science-studio-variable-stars-fall-25) and 
a completed version of our (team CUrious) final report.

> [!NOTE]
> **This repository doesn not refers to any official CU sources**
